SC1015 Mini Project

Problem Statement:
To analyze how the selling price of smartphones is influenced by their brand, memory RAM, and storage space, and to create a predictive model that can accurately estimate a smartphone's market value based on these features (in India)

Key Questions:
1. Can we predict the selling price of a smartphone with reasonable accuracy using brand, memory RAM, and storage space as predictors?
2. How does the brand of a smartphone influence its selling price when controlling for memory RAM and storage space?
3. What is the relative impact of memory RAM and storage space on the selling price across different brands?
