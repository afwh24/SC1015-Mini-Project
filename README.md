# SC1015-Mini-Project

**Problem Statement**: <br/>
To analyze how the selling price of smartphones is influenced by their brand, memory RAM, storage space, and phone ratings and to create a predictive model that can accurately estimate a smartphone's market value based on these features (in India)
<br/><br/>
Determine the key features and factors that drive the sales of smartphones, providing actionable insights for manufacturers and retailers to focus on attributes that enhance sales performance.
 </br>
 
**Key Questions:**
1. Can we predict the selling price of a smartphone with reasonable accuracy using brand, memory RAM, and storage space as predictors?
2. How does the brand of a smartphone influence its selling price when controlling for memory RAM and storage space?
3. What is the relative impact of memory RAM and storage space on the selling price across different brands?
4. How do specific brands compare to each other in terms of the pricing premium attached to RAM and storage space upgrades?
5. Is there a "brand effect" that significantly alters the expected price based on technical specifications alone?
6. Can we identify distinct market segments based on the combination of RAM, storage space, and selling price?
7. How do customer preferences for RAM and storage space vary across different price segments (e.g., budget, mid-range, premium)?
8. Does the impact of increasing RAM on price diminish at higher levels of storage space, or vice versa?
9. Based on the analysis of RAM, storage space, and selling price, what insights can we gather about consumer behavior and preferences in the smartphone market?
10. Are there indications that consumers are willing to pay disproportionately more for slight increases in RAM or storage space at higher price points?
